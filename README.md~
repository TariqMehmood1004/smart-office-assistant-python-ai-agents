# Project Name: Smart Office Assistant
Imagine using your assistant to control your smart office or home: "Turn off the lights in meeting room 3 if no one is there" or "Schedule a call with Sarah at 3 PM and notify both parties."

## Project Idea:
**Build a Smart Office Assistant using intelligent agents in Python that:**
* Responds to voice or text commands
* Controls virtual office devices (lights, AC, doors)
* Schedules meetings and sends reminders
* Handles multi-agent communication (e.g., between RoomAgent and AssistantAgent)
* Can make smart decisions (e.g., saving energy if no one is in the room)

## Real-World Use Case:
Imagine using your assistant to control your smart office or home:
**"Turn off the lights in meeting room 3 if no one is there"** or **"Schedule a call with Sarah at 3 PM and notify both parties."**

## Core Features
### Multi-Agent Capabilities
* **RoomAgent:** Manages occupancy, lights, temperature.
* **MeetingAgent:** Schedules meetings, checks conflicts.
* **NotificationAgent:** Sends alerts/reminders to users.

### Interactivity
* **Voice (optional) or text commands:** via terminal/CLI
* Parses natural language input (basic NLP)
* Decision-making based on office status (time, people, devices)

### Smart Logic
* Avoid scheduling overlaps
* Automatically powers down unused rooms
* Notifies all agents when a change affects them

## Future Enhancements:
### 1. Add Meeting Duration
Allow users to input the duration of the meeting (e.g., 1 hour, 30 minutes). You could also calculate the end time automatically based on the start time and duration.

### 2. Add Room Selection
If you have multiple rooms available for meetings, add functionality for the user to select a room where the meeting will take place.

### 3. Participants Validation
Implement logic to ensure that participants exist in your system or are part of your organization (you can store a list of valid participants or pull from an external source).

### 4. Recurring Meetings
Allow users to schedule recurring meetings, such as weekly or monthly meetings.

### 5. Push Notifications
Integrate notifications or reminders to remind users of scheduled meetings before they start (e.g., 10 minutes before the meeting).

### 6. Graphical View of Schedule
Add a calendar or timeline view to display the scheduled meetings in a more visual format.

### 7. Meeting Notes and Documents
Allow users to attach notes or files (e.g., agendas or documents) to each meeting.

### 8. User Authentication (Login System)
Add user authentication and make sure each user has their own schedule, rather than one shared schedule.

### 9. Admin Features
Allow an admin user to view all schedules, modify them, and possibly approve or reject meeting requests.

### 10. Integration with Calendar Apps (Google, Outlook)
Allow the user to sync the meetings with external calendar apps like Google Calendar or Outlook.

### 11. Custom Conflict Resolution
Implement a more advanced conflict resolution system where you suggest alternative times if there's a conflict with the meeting time.

### 12. UI/UX Enhancements
Improve the UI with better styling, animations, and a more modern look. Maybe even add a dark mode for better accessibility.
