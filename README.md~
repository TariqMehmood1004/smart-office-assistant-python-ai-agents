# Project Name: Smart Office Assistant
Imagine using your assistant to control your smart office or home: "Turn off the lights in meeting room 3 if no one is there" or "Schedule a call with Sarah at 3 PM and notify both parties."

## Project Idea:
**Build a Smart Office Assistant using intelligent agents in Python that:**
* Responds to voice or text commands
* Controls virtual office devices (lights, AC, doors)
* Schedules meetings and sends reminders
* Handles multi-agent communication (e.g., between RoomAgent and AssistantAgent)
* Can make smart decisions (e.g., saving energy if no one is in the room)

## Real-World Use Case:
Imagine using your assistant to control your smart office or home:
**"Turn off the lights in meeting room 3 if no one is there"** or **"Schedule a call with Sarah at 3 PM and notify both parties."**

## Core Features
### Multi-Agent Capabilities
* **RoomAgent:** Manages occupancy, lights, temperature.
* **MeetingAgent:** Schedules meetings, checks conflicts.
* **NotificationAgent:** Sends alerts/reminders to users.

### Interactivity
* **Voice (optional) or text commands:** via terminal/CLI
* Parses natural language input (basic NLP)
* Decision-making based on office status (time, people, devices)

### Smart Logic
* Avoid scheduling overlaps
* Automatically powers down unused rooms
* Notifies all agents when a change affects them

## Future Enhancements:
* Add a web interface for remote control
* Integrate with a smart home system (e.g., Google Home, Amazon Alexa)
* Add support for voice commands
* Implement machine learning for better decision-making
* Add more agents for different functionalities (e.g., security, maintenance)
* Implement a database for persistent storage of schedules and device states
* Add a user authentication system for security
* Implement a logging system for tracking actions and decisions made by the agents
* Add a mobile app interface for remote control
* Implement a machine learning model to predict user behavior and automate tasks accordingly
* Integrate with third-party APIs for additional functionalities (e.g., weather, traffic)
* Add a dashboard for visualizing the status of the office (e.g., occupancy, device states)
* Implement a feedback system for users to provide suggestions or report issues
