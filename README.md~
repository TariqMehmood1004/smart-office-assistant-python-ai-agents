# Project Name: Smart Office Assistant
Imagine using your assistant to control your smart office or home: "Turn off the lights in meeting room 3 if no one is there" or "Schedule a call with Sarah at 3 PM and notify both parties."

## Project Idea:
**Build a Smart Office Assistant using intelligent agents in Python that:**
* Responds to voice or text commands
* Controls virtual office devices (lights, AC, doors)
* Schedules meetings and sends reminders
* Handles multi-agent communication (e.g., between RoomAgent and AssistantAgent)
* Can make smart decisions (e.g., saving energy if no one is in the room)

## Real-World Use Case:
Imagine using your assistant to control your smart office or home:
**"Turn off the lights in meeting room 3 if no one is there"** or **"Schedule a call with Sarah at 3 PM and notify both parties."**

## Core Features
### Multi-Agent Capabilities
* **RoomAgent:** Manages occupancy, lights, temperature.
* **MeetingAgent:** Schedules meetings, checks conflicts.
* **NotificationAgent:** Sends alerts/reminders to users.

### Interactivity
* **Voice (optional) or text commands:** via terminal/CLI
* Parses natural language input (basic NLP)
* Decision-making based on office status (time, people, devices)

### Smart Logic
* Avoid scheduling overlaps
* Automatically powers down unused rooms
* Notifies all agents when a change affects them
